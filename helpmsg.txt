Usage: xetex [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]
   or: xetex [OPTION]... \FIRST-LINE
   or: xetex [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS
  Run XeTeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf.
  Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as XeTeX input, after TEXNAME is read.
  If the first line of TEXNAME is %&FMT, and FMT is an existing .fmt file,
  use it.  Else use `NAME.fmt', where NAME is the program invocation name,
  most commonly `xetex'.

  Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a backslash,
  interpret all non-option arguments as a line of XeTeX input.

  Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a &, the
  next word is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else.  Any
  remaining arguments are processed as above.

  If no arguments or options are specified, prompt for input.
